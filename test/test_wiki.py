# Our hill-climbing algorithm should be able to traverse across both links and categories. Because it is greedy, it should miss the shortcut through the apparently unrelated Warp Pipe pages.

# Hill-climbing path:
# Blueberry -> Apple -> Apple Computer -> Netflix -> Bridgerton (5)

# Secret shortcut path:
# Blueberry -> Mushroom Kingdom Warp Pipe -> Bowser's Castle Warp Pipe  -> Bridgerton (4)
